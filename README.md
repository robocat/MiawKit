# MiawKit

MiawKit is a collection of utilities that makes life a little easier when localizing apps for iOS and OS X. The kit is made up of three different parts that works nice together. The first part is a set of functions that replace ``NSLocalizedString``. The second part is a set of UIKit and AppKit categories on stuff like labels and buttons that make it easier to localize single view parts. The last part is a script that will turn your localized keys from your strings files into constants in your code.
